# Parallel Computing Course Project 1

- Computational Model : Message Passing on a Beowulf Style Cluster.

## [Problem 1](https://github.com/jbnerd/Parallel_computing_project_1/tree/master/Problem%201)

- Parallelizing of the Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm.

## [Problem 2](https://github.com/jbnerd/Parallel_computing_project_1/tree/master/Problem%202)

- Construction of a Global word-document index in a distributed fashion.
	- [**NOTE** : The index itself is local to one node in the cluster. : **END OF NOTE**]
